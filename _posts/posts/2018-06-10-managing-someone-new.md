As a manager one of the things that you will experience is taking on the management of a developer who has recently joined the company. As part of this it is important that you have an initial one to one with them to help you get to know how they like to work and how they like to receive feedback.

In this post I will share my approach to these initial one to ones. If you have your own ideas on how you can make these intitial one to ones effective or you have any questions please post in the comments as I am interested in hearing your thoughts.

The first one to one with someone you are managing for the first time is incredibly important as it allows you to set the expectations for how you will work together going forward. It is also one of the early opportunities to get to know your new developer a little better outside of the recruitment process they went through.

When I first take on the management of a new developer I like to spend some time getting to understand how they like to work with their manager. I don't believe in having a one size fits all management style and I want to be able to adapt how I work with each person that reports to me based on how they want to be managed. I want to give the engineers that report to me the best possible support and guidance I can in a way that suits them.

## Choosing a suitable location

When I do an intial one to one I usually will suggest a location that is relaxed like a local coffee shop rather than a meeting room. This is great as it allows you to get out of the office and get together in a neutral environment. In my experience what I have found is that this makes them feel more comfortable and gives more privacy than a meeting room in the office.

## Introducing the one to one

Having arrived at our location, grabbed a coffee (or in my case a water) and a seat I start by introducing one to ones to the developer.

Unfortunately one to ones can sometimes be a foreign concept as not all managers practice them so I usually will ask them if they have had one to ones with their manager in the past. If the answer is they havent had them previously I will explain to them the reason we have them and the benefits they bring.

## Initial questions to ask in the one to one

Having introduced one to ones to the developer, I then take time to ask them some questions that will help me to learn more about them. The questions I use are as follows:

* When do you feel most productive?
* When do you feel most low?
* What makes you grumpy?
* What activities challenge and motivate you?
* Tell me about the last time you felt truly energised and enthused about your work?
* What type of people do you love working with?
* What type of people do you struggle to work with?
* How do you handle conflict?
* How do you prefer to receive feedback?
* How do you like to receive recognition? Publicly, privately?
* What is important for you to get from me?
* What is the most important thing I can do for you straight away?
* What should I not do?
* What is the biggest gripe you have with (Company Name)?
* What is the biggest opportunity you see for yourself?

These questions were designed to give managers insight into someone they manage and I find them to be a really valuable way to find out more about someone I am managing for the first time.

In particular the questions around how the developer likes to receive feedback are particularly important as I want to be able to give them feedback in a way that is productive and doesn't make them feel uncomfortable.

## Other things to talk about

In the remaining time I would want to share more infomation about the engineering team and their development within it to help them understand what progression they can expect at Beamly. As part of this I will take them through the Engineering Career Ladder so they can properly understand the different levels, roles and responsibilities in the Engineering team.

Finally, as the new employee will have also have just gone though both our recruitment and on boarding processes I will use this opportunity to get feedback on the process.

## Wrapping up the one to one

At the end of the initial one to one I will open my calendar and we will agree on a time that we can meet fortnightly to have our regular one to one. When putting this in the diary I will try to find a time that is unlikely to have conflicts with other meetings in the future.

If they have raised any issues when we were talking I will take them away to resolve.

## Summary

The initial one to one is an opportunity to set up a good working relationship with your new developer. It allows you to set expectations of what they should be able to expect from you and what you expect from them. 

Finally I wanted to point out that the questions I ask were originally given to me by Joel Overton who managed me when he was at Beamly. I believe these were passed down to him from his manager so I am not sure where they originally come from.
