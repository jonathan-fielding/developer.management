As a manager one of the first things you will experience is taking on the management of a employee. They might be someone new to the company or they might be someone who has been with the company for a while and has been reporting to someone else up to this point. 

## Having our first one to one

When I first take on the management of a new employee I like to spend some time getting to understand how they like to work with their manager. The idea is that as a manager I want to give the engineers that report to me the best possible support and guidance I can in a way that suits them. To achieve this I will ask them a set of questions. 

### Questions go here.

### Ending the initial one to one

At the end of the initial one to one I will open my calendar and we will agree on a time that we can meet fortnightly to have our regular one to one. When putting this in the diary I will try to find a time that is unlikely to have conflicts with other meetings in the future.
