In software engineering we spend our time mastering the ability to architect and build code, we become really experienced building **things**. If we then decide to become managers we then suddenly have a huge ammount of other stuff to learn and think about and learning about the latest and greatest new technology can quickly become less of a priority.

The problem is that to be good managers to engineers we need to be up to date so that we can properly understand the decisions our engineers are making. We need to be up to date so that we as engineers can make sane hiring decisions and 

With keeping up to date being so important how can you achieve it. 

# Stay hands on

Firstly it is important you are remaining hands on, should a crunch time arise you should be able to drop less important things and get in the trenches and help out.

# Keep attending community events

One of the biggest ways I ensure I am up to date is to continue going to the same sort of conferences and meetups that I was already attending. So I still go to Frontend London, I still go to London Web Standards and I still make sure I go to FFconf every year. 

On top of this I am now starting to attend conferences like Lead Dev which give more insight into being an effective Lead Engineer.

# Contribute to cross-cutting initiatives

As a engineering manager I am no longer in a product team on the critical path for delivering a new feature or component.

This means I have the time to focus on the development of the engineers that report to me, time to focus on the long term growth and health of the engineering team and time to consult with product teams, offering them guidance on approaches to things they are building.

While at some times in the year this can be really intense and sometimes overwhelming at other times I have bandwidth to work on cross-cutting initiatives that will benefit the engineering team as a whole.
