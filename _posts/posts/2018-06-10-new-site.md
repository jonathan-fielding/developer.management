Developer Management is my new blog focused on being a manager in the software engineering space. I will be posting about different areas of being a manager including recruitment, people management and stakeholder management.

I decided to seperate it out from my main blog at [www.jonathanfielding.com](http://www.jonathanfielding.com) for multiple reasons. Firstly I felt the audience I am targetting is slightly different than that of my primary blog and secondly I would love to in the future open this blog up for guest posts which I wouldn't want to do on my primary blog.
