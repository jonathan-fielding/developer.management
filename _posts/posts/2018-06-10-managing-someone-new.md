As a manager one of the things that you will experience is taking on the management of a developer who has recently joined the company. As part of this it is important that you have an initial one to one with them to help you get to know how they like to work and how they like to receive feedback.

This first one to one with someone you are managing for the first time is incredibly important and you should use it to find out more about your new developer.

When I first take on the management of a new developer I like to spend some time getting to understand how they like to work with their manager. I don't believe in having a one size fits all management style and I want to be able to adapt how I work with each person that reports to me based on how they want to be managed. I want to give the engineers that report to me the best possible support and guidance I can in a way that suits them.

### Initial questions to ask in the one to one

One of the ways in which I get to know a new developer who I am managing is to ask them the following set of set of questions:

* When do you feel most productive?
* When do you feel most low?
* What makes you grumpy?
* What activities challenge and motivate you?
* Tell me about the last time you felt truly energised and enthused about your work?
* What type of people do you love working with?
* What type of people do you struggle to work with?
* How do you handle conflict?
* How do you prefer to receive feedback?
* How do you like to receive recognition? Publicly, privately?
* What is important for you to get from me?
* What is the most important thing I can do for you straight away?
* What should I not do?
* What is the biggest gripe you have with (Company Name)?
* What is the biggest opportunity you see for yourself?

These questions were designed to give managers insight into someone they manage and I find them to be a really valuable way to find out more about someone I am managing for the first time.

In particular the questions arround how the developer likes to receive feedback are particularly important as I want to be able to give them feedback in a way that is productive and doesnt make them feel uncomfortable.

### Other things to talk about

In the remaining time I would want to share more infomation about the engineering team and their development within it to help them understand what progression they can expect at Beamly. As part of this I will take them through the Engineering Career Ladder so they can properly understand the different levels, roles and responsibilities in the Engineering team.

Finaly, as the new employee will have also have just gone though both our recruitment and on boarding processes I will use this opportunity to get feedback on the process.

## Wrapping up the one to one

At the end of the initial one to one I will open my calendar and we will agree on a time that we can meet fortnightly to have our regular one to one. When putting this in the diary I will try to find a time that is unlikely to have conflicts with other meetings in the future.

If they have raised any issues when we were talking I will take them away to resolve.

##Â Summary

The initial one to one is an opportunity to setup a good working relationship with your new developer. It allows you to set expectations of what they should be able to expect from you and what you expect from them. 


Finally I wanted to point out that the questions I ask were originally given to me by Joel Overton who managed me when he was at Beamly. I believe these were passed down to him from his manager so I am not sure where they originally come from.
