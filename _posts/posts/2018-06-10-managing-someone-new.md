As a manager one of the first things you will experience is taking on the management of a employee. They might be someone new to the company or they might be someone who has been with the company for a while and has been reporting to someone else up to this point. 

When you start managing someone new you will want to quickly get to a point where you know the best way in which to give them feedback. The best time in which you can do this is in an intiial one to one.

## Having your first one to one

When I first take on the management of a new employee I like to spend some time getting to understand how they like to work with their manager. I don't believe in having a one size fits all management style and I want to be able to adapt how I work with each person that reports to me based on how they want to be managed. I want to give the engineers that report to me the best possible support and guidance I can in a way that suits them.


### Questions to ask in the one to one

As a starting point I will ask them a set of questions, (note: I did not write these questions, I only wrote the explanations and I don't even know where they originally came from since they were passed down to me by another manager). 
#### When do you feel most productive?

This question aims to help you to understand what time of day they feel they can do their best work. This is important as different people are more product 

#### When do you feel most low?

This 



#### What makes you grumpy?





#### What activities challenge and motivate you?





#### Tell me about the last time you felt truly energised and enthused about your work?



#### What type of people do you love working with?





#### What type of people do you struggle to work with?





#### How do you handle conflict?





#### How do you prefer to receive feedback?





#### How do you like to receive recognition? Publicly, privately?





#### What is important for you to get from me?





#### What is the most important thing I can do for you straight away?

With this question I am trying to find out what I can do to help 

#### What should I not do?



#### What is the biggest gripe you have with (Company Name)?

This question is more useful for reportees who have already been with the company for a while as a new employee hopefully doesn't already have a gripe with the company. With this question, as a manager what I am trying to do is find out if their is any immediate issues I need to work on resolving to ensure that the reportee is happy in their role.

#### What is the biggest opportunity you see for yourself?

With this final question we are aiming to understand what are their long term aims within their career, sometimes this can be a difficult question for them to answer so often I might quantify it, so where do you want to be in your career in 2 years, where do you want to be in 5 years etc.

### Other things to talk about

Aside from going through these questions I also will aim to talk about a number of other things depending on the individual. 

If the employee is new to the company I will use the remaining time to talk a bit more about the company and to take the through the Engineeering carrer ladder. During this I will explain what it is and how it can benefit them.

For an existing employee I will I will spend some time 

## Ending the initial one to one

At the end of the initial one to one I will open my calendar and we will agree on a time that we can meet fortnightly to have our regular one to one. When putting this in the diary I will try to find a time that is unlikely to have conflicts with other meetings in the future.
