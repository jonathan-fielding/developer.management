As a manager one of the things that you will expeirence is taking on the management of a developer who has recently joined the company.

When a new developer joins 

For a developer joining a company they not only have to go through an onboarding with HR they are bombarded with information about the way the company does things. Everything from learning about how the company does source control right though to how they deploy code to production.

When you start managing someone new you will want to quickly get to a point where you know the best way in which to give them feedback. The best time in which you can do this is in an intiial one to one.

## Having your first one to one

The first one to one with someone you are managing for the first time is incredibly important. It often is the first opportunity you will have to discuss with the employee how they like to work with their manager.

It is important to recognise that all your reportees are different and your management style should adjust based on this. To do this you need to be able to answer the following questions:

<ul>
  <li>How senior is the member of staff?</li>
</ul>

When I first take on the management of a new employee I like to spend some time getting to understand how they like to work with their manager. I don't believe in having a one size fits all management style and I want to be able to adapt how I work with each person that reports to me based on how they want to be managed. I want to give the engineers that report to me the best possible support and guidance I can in a way that suits them.


### Initial questions to ask in the one to one

As a starting point I will ask them the following set of questions:

* When do you feel most productive?
* When do you feel most low?
* What makes you grumpy?
* What activities challenge and motivate you?
* Tell me about the last time you felt truly energised and enthused about your work?
* What type of people do you love working with?
* What type of people do you struggle to work with?
* How do you handle conflict?
* How do you prefer to receive feedback?
* How do you like to receive recognition? Publicly, privately?
* What is important for you to get from me?
* What is the most important thing I can do for you straight away?
* What should I not do?
* What is the biggest gripe you have with (Company Name)?
* What is the biggest opportunity you see for yourself?

The purpose of these questions is to help me understand more about them and how they like to be managed. In particular the questions arround feedback will ensure I am able to give them feedback in the most effective way for them.

### Other things to talk about

Aside from going through these questions I also will aim to talk about a number of other things depending on the individual.

If the employee is new to the company I will use the remaining time to talk a bit more about the company and to take the through the Engineeering carrer ladder. During this I will explain what it is and how it can benefit them.

Finaly, as the new employee will have also have just gone though both our recruitment and on boarding processes I will use this opportunity to get feedback on the process. 
 

## After the one to one

At the end of the initial one to one I will open my calendar and we will agree on a time that we can meet fortnightly to have our regular one to one. When putting this in the diary I will try to find a time that is unlikely to have conflicts with other meetings in the future.

If they have raised any issues when we were talking 

## Checking in

At the end of their first week you should put in a 15 minute meeting to check in with them about how things have gone.

## Summary

I intend to write a seperate post in the future on how to run the first one to one with someone who has already been with the company for a long time.
